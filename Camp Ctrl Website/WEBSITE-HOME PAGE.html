                    <p class="about2" >Sol√°na Imani Rowe was born on November 8, 1989, in St. Louis, Missouri, and raised in Maplewood, New Jersey. Her father was an executive producer at CNN. At the same time, her mother was an executive at AT&T. SZA has an older half-sister, Tiffany Daniels, and an older brother, Daniel, aka Manhattan, a rapper. Her mother is Christian, and her father is Muslim. She was raised as a Muslim and continues to follow Islam. She attended a Muslim prep school every day after her regular schooling. However, due to the September 11 attacks, SZA was bullied in 7th grade, leading her to stop wearing her hijab. SZA attended Columbia High School, where she was active in sports, including gymnastics and cheerleading. After graduating high school in 2008, SZA went to three separate colleges, settling at Delaware State University to study marine biology. She eventually dropped out in her last semester; however, she immediately started taking on random jobs to make money. SZA formed her stage name from the Supreme Alphabet, taking influence from rapper RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. The last two letters in her name stand for Zig-Zag and Allah, while the first letter, S, can mean either savior or sovereign. </p>
